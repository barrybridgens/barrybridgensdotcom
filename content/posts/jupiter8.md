I have a couple of Russian lenses that came with Russian rangefinder film cameras such as the Zorki 4K. I recently purchased an adaptor to allow these to be used on my Fuji digital cameras. The first test of this was a trip to Birmingham with a Jupiter 8 50mm f2 lens on my X-E3. With the APS-C crop factor this is equivalent to a 75mm focal length on full frame.

I enjoyed the process of using this lens more than I have with adapted SLR lenses, it is small and light and looks good in the X-E3. Most of the shots were focused with the focus peaking but I do plan to do more zone focusing in the future.

See below for some example photos, all of these are "straight out of camera" and used the "standard" PROVIA film simulation.
