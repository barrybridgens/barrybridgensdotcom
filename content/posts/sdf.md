I have been using the [SDF Public Access Unix System](https://sdf.org "SDF Homepage") again over the holidays. SDF gives "shell access" to a cluster of Unix (NetBSD and Linux) machines via SSH and allows a limited number of Unix commands to be run at the "free" membership level.

I was already an ARPA member which involved a one-off payment ($36) and gave me access to some additional features (including development tools). I have now setup a recurring payment ($36 / year) to get MetaARPA membership which gives access to even more features.

- Access to private MetaARPA and MetaArray servers
- SSL encryption on personal web site
- Unmetered personal website transfer quota
- cron jobs managed via 'mkcron', screen, OpenLISP
- SBCL - A Modern Common Lisp implementation
- Proxying via bouncers like irssi, psybnc
- ssh tunnel/forwarding with alt port
- Access to svn, git, rsync and java
- May write tutorials and system software
- Dynamic domain name service (mdns.org)
- MOTD source code contrib access
- MySQL database on the MetaArray with DBA membership
- SMTP SSL Auth for remote outgoing mail
- Google Reader alternative: tt-rss
- Ability to validate the account of any new user
- Access to SDF's NextCloud instance.

Full membership details can be found at the SDF Homepage linked above.

My use of SDF is mainly for learning more about Unix-like operating systems and also a real nostalgia trip as I have haven't used some of the facilities available, such as Gopher, since I was at University in the early 80's.

Give it a go if you are looking for an "old school" Unix experience. The first level of membership is free and so you have nothing to lose!nostalga
