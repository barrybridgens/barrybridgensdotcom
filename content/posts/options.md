## Options for barrybridgens.com ##

Although this is only the second post to barrybridgens.com, I am already
questioning if Hugo is the best option for this site. The geek in me loves
the idea, all plain text, version controlled in git, etc. but I am not sure how
practical it is for the type of content that I want to create.

As I move my photography from its current
[Home](http://barrybridgensphotography.co.uk) to here I will be posting a lot
of photographs. I am currently using [Wordpress](https:\\www.wordpress.com) for
my photography site and this provides facilities such as galleries etc. that
will, I guess, have to be done manualy in Hugo.

For now I will continue with Hugo and experiment with some photograpy based
content. Watch this space ...
