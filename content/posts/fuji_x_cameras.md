I have been mostly using my Fuji X cameras recently. I have three different "form factors" of these for different situations; X-T2 (SLR style), X-E3 (small range finder style) and X-Pro 2 (larger range finder style). There are not the lastest models and are all second-hand. Purchasing these cameras used is fantastic value for money.

For many people the outstanding feature of the X cameras is the JPEGs that they produce along with the in-built film simulations that can give these JPEGs a very film-like look. I fall into this camp myself and find the JPEGs from these cameras to be very pleasing. That said, I normally shoot RAW+JPEG to keep my options open and I think that this gives "the best of both worlds".

A few example "striaght out of camera JPEGs" are shown below.
