The SDF team regularly run a "bootcamp" to introduce the Plan9 operating system to new people. To help in this they provide temporary access to
a virtual machine running Plan9 (actually the 9front fork). I just missed out on the last bootcamp but got my request in early enough to be accepted
for the current one.

The bootcamp has been running for just over a week now and I have the SDF Plan9 virtual machine up and running have been looking at lots of documentation
in order to understand how it works. I also have a local Plan9 virtual machine running on my Proxmox server, this is much faster but I am still using the
SDF instance for trying things out to remain compatible with the other bootcamp participants.

The SDF team are putting out weekly livestreams and there is also a mailing list setup specifically for the bootcamp. I have learned a lot in the short time that
this has been running so far and hope to learn a lot more in the coming weeks. I do not think that Plan9 will become my regular operating system but it is certainly contains some
interesting ideas. Plan9 was developed by the same people that developed Unix and takes things further. Unix has "everything is a file except for some special cases" but Plan9 removes the special cases. It also has some "strange" design choices which I may write more about as the bootcamp progresses.
