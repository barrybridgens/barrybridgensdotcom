The whole world is on lock-down due the coronavirus and this makes photography somewhat difficult. I have been trying to take some photographs on my allowed exercise walks but the subject matter is obviously limited.

In order to give a bit of variety I have been taking some shots with my Canon AE-1 with "real" black and while film, Ilford HP5 in this case. I have purchased the appropriate chemicals, again from Ilford, and intend to process the film at home.

It has been some years since I last developed black and white film and so this should prove to be an interesting undertaking. I plan to scan the negatives with a macro lens on my Canon EOS 7D using a negative holder from Lomography and a light box to provide illumination.

If the lock-down goes on too long I may even be inspired to break out the enlarger, buy some paper / chemicals and have a go at some wet prints.
