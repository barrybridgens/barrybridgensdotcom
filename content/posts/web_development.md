Lately I have discovered a renewed interest in web development. I have been setting up a server with some very simple "hacking challenges" for an event at work. This is implemented on a [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com "DigitalOcean's Homepage") Ubuntu 18.04 Droplet, the cheapest $5/month option. I had forgotten how interesting this process was and so I think that I will continue to play around with this.

I though about moving **barrybridgens.com** to a pure HTML/CSS site rather than the wordpress site that I have been using. However, in the end I decided to to take a kind of "halfway house" option and move back to using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo Homepage"). As I said in a previous post I like the "geeky" workflow of using a text editor, emacs for me at the moment, and git.
